## 📖 Overview
A **Simple Text Editor** built in **C++** as part of my **DSA Lab Project**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Linked List** data structure to manage text lines dynamically.  

It allows you to:  
- ➕ Insert new text lines  
- ✏️ Edit/change text at a specific position  
- 🔍 Search for keywords in the text  
- ❌ Delete text at a given position  
- 📋 Display all text lines  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Linked List Implementation**: Each line of text is stored as a node.  
- **Dynamic Editing**: Insert, update, or delete lines at any position.  
- **Search Functionality**: Find words inside the text editor.  
- **Menu-driven Interface**: Easy to use in the terminal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++  
- **Concepts**: Linked List, Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation
